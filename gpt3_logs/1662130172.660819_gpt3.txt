The Hurricanes had just wrapped up their first practice of the new season in full pads when the past and present collided on Greentree in the most meaningful of ways. Former Miami cornerback Tolbert Bain made his way to current Miami running back Donald Chaney Jr., patted him on the back and offered a few words of encouragement and advice. And Chaney walked away from their brief interaction with a smile and plenty of gratitude. For him and so many of his teammates, the opportunity to catch up with some of the players who built Miami into a college football powerhouse isn't one they take for granted. There's an unbreakable bond within the UM community. This bloodline can never be broken, no matter who you are or where you are. We're one big, happy family," Chaney said. "I was so happy. He came up to me just now, telling me all these good things, all these good things about the running backs and the team. And all he just said, we need to do even better tomorrowThose players already filled the glass to where it needs to be. Now we've got to refill it again, to even higher standards. Added defensive lineman Elijah Roberts, "They were talking to us, giving us little pointers, telling us what's good, what's bad and what we need to pick up, how they used to do things.
