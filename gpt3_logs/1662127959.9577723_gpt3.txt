Write a detailed summary of the following:

Cristobal, “He’s lived it, breathed it…I remember seeing him at Deli Lane when he became a [graduate assistant] and he was kind of putting together his plan and his plan was to rise up the ranks in coaching. I think anybody that plays, they love their alma mater and you think ‘In the right situation, I’d love to go back there and coach there’ and he had a plan a long time ago to be a great coach and it’s coming to fruition.”                                                                                        For Torretta and the rest of the former Hurricanes, Thursday’s practice was an opportunity to see one of their own leading the charge on Greentree. And a chance to remind the next generation of Hurricanes what they’re capable of doing during their time at Miami. The Miami brotherhood was on full display and players both past and present embraced it. “It means a lot that they’re here. It means a lot. That’s how it should be, especially when you have a program that’s as rich as ours,” said Hurricanes cornerback Al Blades Jr. “We’re able to come off the field and get tips and tricks not only from guys who did it, but guys who dominated at it. It really does mean a lot, for sure.”
