The Hurricanes had just wrapped up their first practice of the new season in full pads when former Miami cornerback Tolbert Bain made his way to current Miami running back Donald Chaney Jr. Bain offered a few words of encouragement and advice, and Chaney walked away from their brief interaction with a smile. For Chaney and his teammates, the opportunity to catch up with some of the players who built Miami into a college football powerhouse is one they don’t take for granted. “There’s an unbreakable bond within the UM community,” Chaney said. “This bloodline can never be broken, no matter who you are or where you are. We’re one big, happy family.” Added defensive lineman Elijah Roberts, “They were talking to us, giving us little pointers, telling us what’s good, what’s bad and what we need to pick up, how they used to do things. And of course, you’re going to listen. They won big games. They won championships. It’s really a good thing to have them here.” While more than a few former Hurricanes players have made their way to Greentree in recent months, Thursday’s practice was particularly special, with Miami hosting its first Alumni Practice under new head coach Mario Cristobal. Among the former Hurricanes players in attendance were Heisman Trophy winner Gino Torretta, four-time Pro Bowler Jeremy Shockey, former national champion and eight-year NFL veteran Vernon Carey, and two-time national champion Brian Blades. They watched as quarterback Tyler Van Dyke, last season’s ACC Rookie of the Year, connected with his receivers. They cheered a few of the big plays made by the Miami defense. And they paid close attention to the drills being run on both sides of the ball. All of that – along with Cristobal’s focus on discipline and detail – will help make a difference when the Hurricanes take the field this season, the former players said. “I’m just so happy to see them competing the way Mario has them competing, the whole coaching staff. They’re doing a great job,” Bain said. “We’re on the right track.” But it’s not just Cristobal’s knowledge of the game and attention to detail that will make a difference, Bain added. That Cristobal understands the kind of work it takes to achieve the ultimate success in college football and that he knows the richness of Miami’s tradition are key, too. “It’s special when it’s a former player. And he was a high-intensity player. He coaches the same way he plays,” Bain said. “You love to see that. He holds every kid accountable. He holds every coach accountable. And that was exactly like it was when I came in under Howard [Schnellenberger] and played under Jimmy [Johnson]. Both of those guys were intense and they wanted you to be intense, 100 miles per hour and it’s just a beautiful, beautiful thing to see. Everybody’s happy. Everybody’s excited.”

On Thursday, current and former Miami Hurricanes football players gathered for practice on Greentree Field. For Torretta and other Hurricanes alumni, it was an opportunity to see one of their own, Cristobal, leading the charge as the team's new head coach. The Miami brotherhood was on full display as players embraced each other, past and present. Blades Jr. commented on how significant it is to have the alumni present, saying that they offer valuable insight and knowledge to the current players.
